defmodule Arbiter.Polecats.Reconciler do
  @moduledoc """
  Reconciles orphaned `:running` `Arbiter.Polecats.Run` rows on boot.

  A polecat GenServer is ephemeral: it writes a `:running` Run row on init and
  stamps the terminal status (`:completed` / `:failed`) when it stops. If the
  node dies between those two writes — a crash, a hard restart — the row is left
  `:running` forever. `arb prime` tracks live processes, so it correctly shows
  no active acolytes, but the durable history lies: it claims work is still in
  flight when the process that owned it is long gone.

  This module sweeps those orphans. A `:running` row whose `bead_id` has no live
  polecat registered under `Arbiter.Polecat.Registry` is marked `:failed` with a
  `failure_reason` of `"server restarted"`.

  The sweep keys off the LOCAL process registry, so it must run on exactly one
  instance: a second app booting against the same DB (an acolyte running
  `iex -S mix` while the real server is up) cannot see the primary's live
  polecats and would mistake its running rows for orphans. `reconcile_orphaned_runs/0`
  is therefore not wired directly into boot — `Arbiter.Polecats.ReconcileGuard`
  gates it behind a single-instance advisory lock and invokes it only on the
  canonical node (bd-9rouwh).

  The sweep is best-effort: a DB hiccup logs a warning and returns `{:error, _}`
  rather than crashing the supervision tree at boot.
